 HUN_elect_italian_king_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the Great War our country has been a kingdom without a king. We have been long trying to find a ruler suited for our land, and recently our Italian friends have approached us with an interesting proposal. They suggest we grant the crown of Saint Stephen to prince Amedeo of Savoy, duke of Aosta, first cousin once-removed of king Victor Emmanuel III. This would make our nations' bond even tighter due to dynastic ties and would grant us a renowned gentleman as monarch of a new and better Hungary."
