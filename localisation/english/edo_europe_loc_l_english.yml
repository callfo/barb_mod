Therefore, this is a free ressource, that anyone can use, as long as they credit the original mod. You are free to do any submods or total conversion mod over it. \n The reason behind all the development done so far is to have a fully playable map: I have already done some map ressources before, but because of the involved difficulty in using these, nobody has ever done a map using them (apart from Primo Victoria, still in development, check these lads on the Coop, they do great stuff). Therefore, whether you want to make a post-apocalyptic map, a WW2 mod focused on Europe or a border-gore simulator, go ahead, you have my blessing."

 presentation_event.4.d:0 "I am very well aware that this mod is incomplete. While it is playable, it features much less content than the vanilla game, and some areas are lackluster. While I did my best to add all possible accurate WW2 borders and allow their reproduction in game, the number of state has been greatly cut down: we had a version with 1500 states, however, the lag became soon unbearable, and it has been decided to restart the mod from the beginning, which is why we only have 450 states at the moment. Additionally, our team is currently very small, with merely 5 members, who are not always active due to IRL time constraint. Therefore, we are open to anyone willing to help the mod, and any help would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, submods are greatly appreciated, and if they are working well and provide good content, we are open to the possibility of integrating them (if their creators are ok with it of course)."

Taking these two states will make these resources disappear. \n There are some hidden canal, allowing transport between the Barents Sea and the Atlantic, and between the Persian Hulf and the Red Sea"

Holland for the Netherlands (we didn't had an other place to put it). Should these states fail, the ressources will be deleted, as the out-of-map areas (continental US and colonies) will stop supplying Europe with their ressources. However, when their owner takes back control of the state, the flow of ressource will resume. \nKuwait has an exception in the case where if it is in a faction with the UK, the English colonies will keep supplying Europe. \nAnother exception to this rule is the Netherlands: should they fall, chaos will errupt in the Dutch East Indies, preventing the rubber from coming back to Europe. Also, in the event that somehow the Netherland survive in December 41, they'll lost control of their colonies again because of the Japanese invasion. Even though Japan was a member of the tripartie pact, their de-facto cooperation with the Axis was quite limited, and they won't send their ressources to Germany. So, investing in rubber production as a member of the Axis is a good idea."
