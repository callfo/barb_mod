# Temp variables
# Old actions will be stored as temp variables
# For Winners:
#	taken_states@TAG: an array where each element contains the state that is taken by country TAG
#	taken_by@STATE_ID: is set to country that took the state
# For Losers:
# 	current_states@TAG: Remaining states of loser
# For each subject action:
#   subject_states@TAG : an array where each element contains the state that is subjected by country TAG
#   subject_countries@TAG : an array where each element contains the country that is subjected by country TAG
#   subjected_by@STATE_ID : a variable for each state that is subjected by a country, value is overlord
#   subjected_by@TAG : an array for each loser that is subjected, array contains overlord
# For each liberated:
#   liberate_states@TAG : an array where each element contains the state that is liberated by country TAG
#   liberate_countries@TAG : an array where each element contains the country that is liberated by country TAG
# A trigger named "build_temp_vars" will be called before any evaluation so further temp variables can be calculated
